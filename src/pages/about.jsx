                <h2>About me!</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Kegan. Graduate from NUS High School, Class of 2024. Currently stuck serving 2 years of mandatory National Service. growing up as a son of a carpenter and leatherworker, I've always loved designing and making things with my own two hands. From graffiti and tattoo designs to clothing and technical drawings to models and pratical tools, anything probably worth sharing will be put up here for anyone to see.</p>
                <p>I've also been accepted into NUS Architecture, so I'm taking advantage of this time in the army to brush up on my art skill before going back to school. Simultaneously, I'm documenting this process both so that I can be proud of how far I've come and so that I have something to show for my efforts.</p>
                <p>When not busying my hands to make things, I like to go skating (probably where I got my graffiti tendencies), climbing or looking for food. Probably looking for food. </p>
                <p>Never really made a proper art portfolio so here we are. I also really wanted to make a website, so this portfolio website is where I'm learning how to make websites. Like my work? Check out my contact page for a commission. Currently serving National Service so updates may be sparse.</p>
